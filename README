Provides a task to build and execute unittests through dub.
Tests may be run directly or through tested to provide more details.
It is recommended to use tested as the default unittest runner does not provide enough information,
such as what tests are being run and how long each test takes.
Once "dub test" is implemented, that will be used for running tests.
